# simple-blockchain-network
This repository shows a simple blockchain network implementation. Each instance can be considered a blockchain node. You can use the API endpoints defined in `routes.js` to interact with the nodes.

## Launch a node
Launch a node by running `node index.js --port <PORT>` (defaults to port 3000)
